# Test Expression Template
#########################################################################################
#########################################################################################
#
# This file intends to gather all existing values which can be used to build test 
# expressions. We want to give the best possible customization. If you think a mandatory
# piece of information cannot be forwarded to built test, please let us know.
#
# A Test Expression defines rules to build one or more tests from it. This way, you can
# basically specify a binary name (ex simple_TE), ready to be validated through the system
# for any system-configured combination. If the system is configured to iterate over 
# n_node [1,2] and n_proc [2, 4], the simplest Test Expression (just a name) will generate 
# 4 test combinations: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2) and (2, 4). To describe a Test Expression, 
# we rely on YAML description, where the root value for each element depicts the Test Expression
# name. The effective test name will be generated depending on the number of iterators 
# applied to it. In the example above, we could have the following tests:
#     - (1, 2) --> simple_TE_node1_proc2
#     - (1, 4) --> simple_TE_node1_proc4
#     - (2, 2) --> simple_TE_node2_proc2
#     - (2, 4) --> simple_TE_node2_proc4
#
# A Test Expression (TE) provides a way to gather information, to build a more 
# powerful and robust validation with less effort.
#
# Any Test Expression needs at least a name. By default, the system will try to find a 
# source file with the same name and will build a binary named "$name.bin". However,
# we discourage using targets this way, extending test building time significantly.
#
# You can use some macros to refer absolute path:
#   - @SRCPATH@ : points to the current source directory (where this file is located)
#   - @BUILDPATH@ : points to the current build directory ( under $buildir)
#
# TE = Test Expression

# Combination alteration
#########################################################################################
# We will describe how to write Combination attributes for a test Expression.
# These attributes are only used if the TE is one of {'complete', 'run'} type.
# First, a quick introduction to 'sequence values'. You can provide whatever you want as an
# array item. By convention, iterators starting with /^n_/ will be considered to be numeric
# but no specific introspection will be done. When the array is analyzed, some specific
# syntaxes exist helping you to formulate the list of values for the iterator. We will show
# here these syntax. You can simply add them in an array like a single value (A, B and C
# are supposed integers) :
# - [ "A-B" ] : Serialize value from A to B (i.e. with a step equal to 1)
# - [ "A:B:+C" ] : Create a sequence starting from A(included) to B (included) with a step of +C
# - [ "A:B:*C" ] : Create a sequence (math meaning) following U(n) = U(n-1)*C, U(0) = A, max(n) = B
# - [ "A:B:^C" ] : List 'the power of C' values existing between A(included) and B(included)  
# - [ ">A" ] : Filter the system iterator list by keeping values strictly higher than A 
#              ('>=' can be used to include A, equivalent to '>(A-1)')
# - [ "<A" ] : Filter the system iterator list by keeping values strictly lower than A
#              ('<=' can be used to include A, equivalent to '<(A+1)')

# here, we tag this iterator as irrelevant for this TE. this iterator will be removed
# from combinatory system. Due to YAML syntax, '~' is roughly equivalent to 'null' and create
# an 'undef' node into the YAML tree. An empty array is NOT equivalent to it. An empty array
# means that the iterator is valid but NO combinations will be ever be valid for it. This leads
# the system to invalidate the TE. In case of 'complete' TE type, the 'build' is kept.
simple_test:
        n_mpi: ~
        n_mpi: null

# these three iterator definitions are equivalent and generate integer list between 1 and 9
simple_test:
        n_mpi: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        n_mpi: ["1-9"]
        n_mpi: ["1:9:+1"]

# these two iterator definitions are equivalent and generate even values between 2 and 12
simple_test:
        n_mpi: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
        n_mpi: [ "2:12:+2" ]

# Equivalent: Generate 'power of two' values between 1 and 16
simple_test:
        n_mpi: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
        n_mpi: ["1:16:*2"]

# Equivalent: Generate 'square' values between 1 and 50
simple_test:
        n_mpi: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
        n_mpi: [ "1:50:^2"]

#equivalent: Generate 'cubic' values between 156 and 216
simple_test:
        n_mpi: [27, 64, 125, 216]
        n_mpi: [ "15:216:^3"]

#For this example, we suppose system iterator list equals to n_mpi = [ "2-10" ]
#These three iterator definitions are equivalent and keep a list of values between 1 and 7 (included)
#Note that you can have as many space as you want between the operator and the number
simple_test: 
        n_mpi: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        n_mpi: [1, ">=4", '<=7']
        n_mpi: [1, " >3", '< 8']

# Dependencies
#########################################################################################
# TE tagged with the "build" type won't be unrolled by the combinatory system. Indeed,
# number of nodes or processors does not affect the compilation step. However, the TE based
# on "compile-and-run" will build the binary once per test. This is wasteful if your wish is to
# run multiple times the same binary with varying parameters. That's why we handle
# dependencies.

# "build" type TE
compile_make:
        # ... We assume you know how to fill this TE with what we showed earlier.
        type: "build"
        files: "@SRCPATH@/Makefile.test"
        target: "TEST-1"
        cargs: "VERBOSE=1"

# This TE will provide a new field: "deps", an array containing a list of names 
# This dependency does not only allow to build the binary once, but also ensure that deps 
# will be successfully run before executing tests from this TE. 
run_target:
        # ... We assume you know how to fill this TE with what we showed earlier.
        deps: [ "compile_make" ]
        limit: 100
        tolerance: 5
        args: "--run-args"
        iter: ["nnode", "nproc", "ncore"]
        n_node: [1, 2]
        n_proc: [4, 8]
        returns: 0

# Templating
#########################################################################################
# This final section describes a way to make TE writing denser, avoiding redundant text,
# easing validation updates. Template TE won't be executed at all, and exist just to be 
# included into other TEs.
#
# IMPORTANT: To be recognized, a TE template should have its name starting by "pcvst_",
# this is mandatory to avoid adding an extra field inside the TE (making the process heavier).
#
# This feature is still experimental and only allow one level of templating. We don't support
# (and don't want to support) template's template (and so on).

# Similarly to dependencies, templates expose a label
pcvst_random_name: &model
        type: "run"
        deps: [ "compilemake1" ]
        bin: "TEST-1.bin" 
        time: 100
        tolerance: 2

no_stress_test:
        # the field "herit" attach the template to the current TE definition.
        herit : *model
        args: '-iter 100 -cache off'

very_stressful_test:
        herit : *model
        args: '-iter 10000 -cache on'

# In case you don't have any extra field, compared to the template, the two following
# definitions are equivalent.
basic_test: 
        herit: *wildcard

basic_test2: *wildcard
